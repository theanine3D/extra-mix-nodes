# Features
- Mix colors between 3-5 different textures with just a single node
- Splat map nodes allow you to use the RGB or RBGA channels from a "splat map" texture to determine the blending.

## How to use
In the Shader Editor, press the "Add" button on the top menu or press Shift + A. Then choose the "Group" category, and you'll find all the extra mix nodes there.
